To upload a gallery, simply upload a folder with images in them.
It's that simple!
The title of the gallery will default to the folder name.
(Feature pending) If you wish to change the title and other options, upload a config.xml folder with your gallery.

Notes:
Some galleries may require other files, like a .js script file or audio files to play properly
